Welcome to the capi-portal, this project is a monorepo consisting of a desktop folder and an api folder.
There are a few things you need to do before you can start working on this project.
# .env

Place .env file in .erb/configs with the following values:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
FIREBASE_API_KEY=abc123
```

Once these files have been added you can run a "yarn" and "yarn start:dev" in your terminal to start up the backend of the project.

Happy Coding Capi!
