Welcome to the capi-portal, this is the front-end of the project.
The back-end can be found here: https://gitlab.com/codecapi/codecapi-portale-api
There are a few things you need to do before you can start working on this project.
# .env

Place .env file in .erb/configs with the following values:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
FIREBASE_API_KEY=abc123
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc123
AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY=abc123
```

Once these files have been added you can run a "yarn" and "yarn start:dev" in your terminal to start up the backend of the project.

Happy Coding Capi!
